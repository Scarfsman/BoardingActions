969|1|Warboss|ORK|46.0|A towering slab of muscle, fangs and bad attitude, the Warboss leads the charge from the very front.

970|2|Warboss In Mega Armour|ORK|46.0|Any good Ork hunter knows the safest way to deal with a rampaging Warboss is to hit them with tank-busting artillery from as far away as possible.

Serendipitously, it also works well when searing through an enemy’s armour at close quarters, or, with a twist of its nozzle, can instead belch a tongue of roaring flame over the foe.
