4|909|AC|Voyagers in Darkness|<b>Some shield companies of the Adeptus Custodes set sail into the darkness between the stars, either guided by visions of the Emperor’s will or believing that they can do the most to defend Terra by seeking out and destroying distant threats.</b>|Boarding Actions|
5|910|AC|Black Ship Guardians|<b>Whether fighting furiously to prevent enemies from boarding one of the sinister Black Ships and freeing its psyker inmates, or sweeping into an enemy vessel or installation to seize and imprison powerful witches, the Sisters of Silence are a force to be reckoned with in void warfare.</b>|Boarding Actions|
13|912|AdM|Electromartyrs|<b>When precious technoreliquaries must be protected or rare archeotech seized in shipboard battles, Tech-Priests quickly cast aside whatever restraint they may have had. Lesser underlings are expended without a care and perilous technologies unleashed in the quest for higher knowledge.</b>|Boarding Actions|
14|913|AdM|Response Clade|<b>Just as white blood cells will defend a Human body, so the clades of Skitarii embedded on Adeptus Mechanicus vessels respond with systematic aggression to enemy intrusions. Once their own ship is secure, they are capable of counterboarding operations to destroy the threat at its source.</b>|Boarding Actions|
15|914|AdM|Machine Cult|<b>The voidships of the Adeptus Mechanicus are as much spacegoing temples to the Omnissiah as they are floating forges or esoteric warships. The teeming tech-clergy aboard such ships form zealous armies in their own right, responding with fanatical aggression to any foe.</b>|Boarding Actions|
17|919|AE|Khaine’s Arrow|<b>Honed to a single, perfect point, the Aeldari Aspect Warriors streak across the void of space aboard Vampire Raiders before plunging deep into the heart of the enemy ship. Perhaps they strike the bridge. Maybe they pierce the defences of the enginarium. Wherever they hit home, they bring doom to the foe.</b>|Boarding Actions|
18|920|AE|Protector Host|<b>The Aeldari fight furiously to defend their irreplaceable voidships - doubly so if the conflict threatens one of their spacefaring craftworlds. In such a battle they deploy their full might without a second thought, citizen soldiery and Aspect Warriors alike rallying to defend that which is precious to them.</b>|Boarding Actions|
19|921|AE|Wraiths of the Void|<b>When a void battle is sufficiently vital or desperate, the Aeldari awaken their wraith constructs. Resilient, powerful and utterly focused upon their duty, such ghost warriors are a force of unimaginable devastation amidst the close confines of a boarding battle.</b>|Boarding Actions|
20|922|AE|Star-dancer Masque|<b>When Harlequins board an enemy ship they follow Saedath that cast them in the roles of void-soaring mythic hawks and serpents, or else the heroes Ulthanash and Eldanesh raiding the stronghold of some monstrous foe. They flow through the steps with blistering speed, laying low all who oppose them.</b>|Boarding Actions|
31|927|AM|Embarked Regiment|<b>Astra Militarum regiments spend months, even years, travelling aboard voidships between war zones. Many fortify their billets during such long periods of inactivity, whether against the danger of hostile boarders, or to hide illicit activities from prying discipline masters!</b>|Boarding Actions|
32|928|AM|Tempestus Boarding Regiment|<b>The Militarum Tempestus excel in high-intensity, fast-moving raids. Some of their regiments further refine these specialisms towards the boarding of voidships, storming vital locations to seize and scuttle the vessel or extract vital personnel from the foe’s clutches.</b>|Boarding Actions|
42|924|AoI|Voidship’s Company|<b>Comprising the shipboard garrison and those who command them, this is a balanced force specialising in both the defence of, and boarding of voidships. Going chamber by chamber to secure and control vital systems and locations, this naval complement know their business all too well.</b>|Boarding Actions|
43|925|AoI|Interdiction Team|<b>Whether boarding a vessel smuggling unsanctioned psyker-mutants, eliminating the unholy allies of some corrupt Planetary Governor, or moving swiftly to snatch proscribed interstellar contraband, Adeptus Arbites Interdiction Teams handle the most perilous of void crimes with extreme prejudice.</b>|Boarding Actions|
49|916|AS|Pious Protectors|<b>The Adepta Sororitas are no strangers to void combat. Boltguns, flamers and melta weapons make excellent tools for cleansing obstinate foes from the decks of a vessel.</b>|Boarding Actions|
50|917|AS|Penitents and Pilgrims|<b>The Ecclesiarchy’s priests travel huge distances in service to the God-Emperor, often to visit holy shrines or take part in Wars of Faith. The penitents and pilgrims who comprise their travelling flocks are zealously devoted to the faith, and relish the opportunity to prove their faith in battle.</b>|Boarding Actions|
53|953|CD|Daemonic Incursion|<b>Warp travel is fraught with perils, the greatest of which is a breach of the voidship’s Geller fields. In but the beat of a mortal heart, scores of infernal entities manifest aboard the doomed ship, shrieking with predatory glee as they fall upon their victims.</b>|Boarding Actions|
54|954|CD|Infernal Onslaught|<b>Whether it be aboard the echoing corridors of a space hulk, storming through the gothic confines of a loyalist warship, or spilling from the warp into a xenos vessel, such close-quarters violence draws the daemons of Khorne in great number.</b>|Boarding Actions|
55|955|CD|Rotten and Rusted|<b>The daemons of the Plague God Nurgle slither through enemy voidships like seeping corruption given malevolent form. Their very touch breeds foulness, tendrils of rust spreading across bulkheads as the bodies of their slain foes squirm with pestilential vermin.</b>|Boarding Actions|
56|956|CD|Dread Carnival|<b>Lithe and graceful, the daemons of Slaanesh cavort across the decks of enemy voidships, bombarding their victims’ senses with hypnotic dances and soporific aromas before butchering them in the most outlandishly gory fashion imaginable.</b>|Boarding Actions|
57|957|CD|Pandaemoniac Inferno|<b>Once the daemons of Tzeentch are loose aboard a ship they spread like a kaleidoscopic firestorm. Their mad cackles meld with the screams of their victims as the daemons’ mutative touch twists both the infested voidship and the unfortunates who defend it, blending them amidst gruesome conflagrations of change.</b>|Boarding Actions|
71|946|CSM|Infernal Reavers|<b>Many Chaos Space Marines warbands ply established void routes, preying upon passing shipping. These cruel raiders excel in shipboard combat, seizing plunder and slaughtering entire crews as bloody offerings to their Dark Gods.</b>|Boarding Actions|
72|947|CSM|Underdeck Uprising|<b>It takes only the slightest seed of corruption to spread sedition and heresy through the downtrodden and desperate crew-serfs packed into many voidships’ bilges and gun decks. Whipped into a traitorous frenzy by demagogues promises of power, mutants and madmen rise up en masse to seize the ship.</b>|Boarding Actions|
73|948|CSM|Champions of Chaos|<b>Every Chaos Lord has a cadre of chosen warriors and dread lieutenants to enforce their will. When the mightiest enemy flagships must be taken, or the bridge of their own vessel held at all costs, it is these chosen champions of the Chaos Gods who step forth to fight.</b>|Boarding Actions|
76|930|DG|Vectors of Decay|<b>The Death Guard are well-practised in shipboard warfare and punishing boarding actions. Spearing deep in the enemy vessel like the tendrils of some nightmare parasite, they spread corruption and entropy through foes and mechanical systems alike.</b>|Boarding Actions|
77|931|DG|Unclean Uprising|<b>Under the corrupting influence of Nurgle’s worshippers, voidships can sicken just like living bodies. Corridors awash with chanting, diseased cultists, chambers and vital systems clogged by rancid entities and plague-spawned filth, even the most redoubtable warship can sicken and die.</b>|Boarding Actions|
78|932|DG|Arch-Contaminators|<b>Spearheading assaults onto enemy voidships or digging in to defend the most vital of their own plague ships’ systems and chambers, these chosen of Mortarion are as indomitable as they are foul. No foe can long endure their feculent ferocity.</b>|Boarding Actions|
87|934|DRU|Space Lane Raiders|<b>The Drukhari delight in launching piratical attacks on their victims’ voidships, gathering realspace raiding parties just as they would to assail an enemy world. Such close and nightmarish confines suit these raiding bands particularly well. Soon enough, the voidship rings to the screams of its defenders...</b>|Boarding Actions|
88|935|DRU|Kabalite Corsairs|<b>Every Drukhari Kabal is as much malevolent crime syndicate as it is private army, often with its own specialist areas of insidious expertise. Some Archons have a predilection for piratical boarding and raiding of voidships, their warbands honing their skills in these areas above all others.</b>|Boarding Actions|
89|936|DRU|Ship-killer Cult|<b>Employing esoteric technologies to transmit their exploits back to debauched audiences in Commorragh, some Wych Cults board voidships as a kind of murderous death-sport. Here, the voidship becomes the arena, and the Wyches’ every violent action the entertainment for their baying fans.</b>|Boarding Actions|
90|937|DRU|Painbringers|<b>The twisted fleshcrafters of the Haemonculus Covens seek to seize fresh captives for their laboratories. Boarding enemy vessels, they rely upon their menageries of mutant creations to smash through bulkheads and rip open hatches. The Haemonculi and their creations are empowered by pain both given and received, and will fight on through injuries that would spell doom for lesser beings.</b>|Boarding Actions|
107|939|GC|Cult Unveiled|<b>Many Genestealer Cults seek to spread beyond their birth worlds by smuggling broods of the faithful onto departing voidships. Though cunning, some such cult cells are discovered before they reach their destinations. In such circumstances, they will fight furiously to overtake their host vessel entirely.</b>|Boarding Actions|
108|940|GC|Genespawn Onslaught|<b>Unleashed by a voidborne cult as a deadly boarding spearhead, or boiling up from the depths of a host vessel as the first blow struck by a cult rising in its underdecks, this tide of horrors crushes all before it. Blessed by the Star Children, these favoured of the cult can be relied upon to wreak absolute havoc.</b>|Boarding Actions|
109|941|GC|Infestation Swarm|<b>Many doomed voidships have been infested by Genestealers, their corridors and crawlways transformed into the hunting grounds and brood-lairs of monstrous vanguard organisms. Such infestations prove nightmarishly deadly to any unwise enough to board these apparent derelicts.</b>|Boarding Actions|
111|943|GK|Void Purge Force|<b>Whether striking into a warp-compromised vessel to annihilate all aboard, defending a vital Grey Knights warship from infernal threats, or removing allies or foes who know too much, these strike teams of Grey Knights hit hard and fast to ensure none escape their purge.</b>|Boarding Actions|
112|944|GK|Baneslayer Strike|<b>The infernal power of dire threats such as the Heretic Astartes, the Daemons of Chaos or the most abominable of xenos horrors is magnified within the close quarters of shipboard war. The Grey Knights have the tools to deal with even such arch-fiends, however, and they come clad in Terminator plate.</b>|Boarding Actions|
119|950|LoV|Void Salvagers|<b>The salvage fleets of the Leagues of Votann secure material resources and recover stolen technologies. Their aggressive salvage operations bring them into conflict with hostile foes. It is fortunate, therefore, that Kin soldiers are well suited to combat in the close confines of space hulks and voidships.</b>|Boarding Actions|
120|951|LoV|Hearthfire Strike|<b>During the most punishing void battles, when the butcher’s bill is spiralling but the promised rewards still justify the cost of conflict, the most expedient plan is often also the most direct. Gathering the might of the Einhyr, the Kin launch a single, thunderous strike to end all enemy resistance.</b>|Boarding Actions|
132|959|NEC|Tomb Ship Complement|<b>The phaerons of the Necron dynasties possess some of the most powerful voidships in the known galaxy. These gigantic vessels carry full complements of Necron Warriors, Lychguard, Canoptek constructs and other lethal assets that can repel boarders or slaughter enemy crews with ease.</b>|Boarding Actions|
133|960|NEC|Deranged Outcasts|<b>Whilst the minds of many Necrons have been afflicted by the Great Sleep, the outcast Destroyer Cults and Flayed Ones have lost all semblance of sanity. Necron commanders often unleash these insane killers on their most hated foes, trusting that they will slaughter every last living being.</b>|Boarding Actions|
134|961|NEC|Canoptek Harvesters|<b>Created to defend the Necrons’ tomb worlds, Canoptek constructs are often repurposed to harvest valuable resources for their Cryptek overseers. These murderous automatons will phase through walls, atomise deck plates and obliterate the living in order to achieve their masters’ goals.</b>|Boarding Actions|
142|963|ORK|Ramship Raiders|<b>When Ork void fleets attack enemy shipping, they often lead the assault with ramships. These pugnacious craft slam headlong into the foes’ vessels, burying themselves in the superstructure of larger enemy ships before filling them with rampaging Ork boarders.</b>|Boarding Actions|
143|964|ORK|Kaptin Killers|<b>Regardless of the wider objectives of a void war, once a Warboss and his best Boyz get aboard an enemy ship their top priority is nearly always finding the enemy shipmaster and beating them to a pulp. If that leads to capturing the vessel in the process, so much the better!</b>|Boarding Actions|
170|905|SM|Boarding Strike|<b>Space Marines excel in the sort of fast-paced, ferociously violent battles that erupt during voidship boarding assaults. Moving fast and hitting hard, they swiftly secure enemy vessels, or else sweep impertinent foes from their own warships’ decks.</b>|Boarding Actions|
171|906|SM|Pilum Strike Team|<b>Comprising veterans in the theatre of ship-to-ship void war, pilum strike teams are cast through the void like a spear aboard shrouded boarding torpedoes to infiltrate key enemy warships. Once aboard, the Phobos-armoured Space Marines wage a terror campaign to destabilise the target vessel from within.</b>|Boarding Actions|
172|907|SM|Terminator Assault|<b>The Imperium has no finer or more perfectly suited warriors for cleansing the claustrophobic decks of voidships than Terminators. Each battle-brother is an army unto themself. Their armoured resilience is second to none, while their massive firepower allows them to turn gloomy corridors into killing grounds.</b>|Boarding Actions|
194|966|TAU|Starfire Cadre|<b>When mobilised en masse for shipboard warfare, the interconnected teams of a Starfire Cadre are swiftly moved into position by Air caste assets before commencing aggressive sweep-and-clear operations.</b>|Boarding Actions|
195|967|TAU|Kroot Raiding Party|<b>The Kroot are frighteningly effective combatants amidst the cramped conditions of a boarding action. Spilling from the Warspheres in fast-moving raiding parties, they hunt their victims deck by deck and leave carnage in their wake.</b>|Boarding Actions|
198|969|TS|Chosen Cabal|<b>At the command of the Thousand Sons Sorcerers, Rubric Marines and cultist thralls press through the labyrinthine corridors of enemy voidships with impossible precision, seizing objectives from under the noses of their confounded foes.</b>|Boarding Actions|
199|970|TS|Devoted Thralls|<b>Having boarded by deceit and infiltration or through conjured warp portals, the mortal cultists of Tzeentch surge through the vessels of voidships to unleash riotous displays of witchery and violence on behalf of their Thousand Sons masters.</b>|Boarding Actions|
200|971|TS|Fateseekers|<b>Amidst the twisting corridors of voidships, upon the strange tides of the warp, many esoteric and powerful prizes wait to be claimed. Having scried the paths of fate that will lead them to these prizes, Thousand Sons Sorcerers set out with trusted coteries to claim them.</b>|Boarding Actions|
213|973|TYR|Tyranid Attack|<b>Amidst the dark of the void, the alien horror of the Tyranids is rendered all the more terrifying. Whether swarming forth to defend their own bio-ships or stalking their prey through the decks of voidships or star forts, the hunting swarms leave none alive.</b>|Boarding Actions|
214|974|TYR|Boarding Swarm|<b>When Tyranid hive ships latch onto prey vessels, they unleash tailored swarms of swift vanguard organisms whose purpose is to sow terror amongst the defenders and strike for vital targets such as the enginarium and command bridge.</b>|Boarding Actions|
215|975|TYR|Biotide|<b>Whether responding to attacks by hostile boarding parties or spilling into an already-breached prey vessel, these unceasing waves of warrior organisms overrun their victims like a multiplying virus.</b>|Boarding Actions|
216|979|TYR|Infestation Swarm|<b>Many doomed voidships have been infested by Genestealers, their corridors and crawlways transformed into the hunting grounds and brood-lairs of monstrous vanguard organisms. Such infestations prove nightmarishly deadly to any unwise enough to board these apparent derelicts.</b>|Boarding Actions|
220|977|WE|Boarding Butchers|<b>Whether attacking an enemy voidship, or counterassaulting foes unwise enough to board a World Eaters vessel, these blood-drenched slaughterers reduce their victims to headless carcasses with shocking speed. Such close confines suit these murderous berzerkers perfectly.</b>|Boarding Actions|
221|978|WE|Skullsworn|<b>The elite of the World Eaters burn with the unholy blessings of Khorne. However, such might is not given freely. Storming headlong into the close-quarters carnage of a boarding action is the ideal way in which such empowered warriors can claim the tithe of skulls they owe their Dark God.</b>|Boarding Actions|
